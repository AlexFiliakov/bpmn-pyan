  pyan
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modified pyan.py by Juha Jeronen, based on original pyan.py by Edmund Horner.

The modified version has some additional features for GraphViz output that can be useful for working with large projects.

New command-line options are available to:

- Color nodes automatically (-c). A HSL color model is used, picking the hue based on the top-level namespace (effectively, the module). The colors start out light, and then darken for each level of nesting. Seven different hues are available, cycled automatically.

- Group nodes in the same namespace (-g, -e). GraphViz clusters are used for this. The namespace name is used as the cluster label. Groups can be created as standalone (-g, always inside top-level graph) or nested (-e). The nested mode follows the namespace structure of the code.

- Disable generation of links for “defines” relationships (-n). This can make the resulting graph look much clearer, when there are a lot of “uses” relationships. This is especially useful for layout with “fdp”.

- Disable generation of links for “uses” relationships (-N). Can be useful for visualizing just where functions are defined.


Other changes:

The “defines” relations are now drawn with gray arrows, so that it’s easier to visually tell them apart from the “uses” relations when there are a lot of edges of both types in the graph. (The dotted line style is the same as in the original.)

Nodes are now always filled (white if color disabled), and made translucent to clearly show arrows passing underneath them. This is useful for large graphs with the fdp filter.

With the exception of the disable switches, which support both output formats, all modifications are for GraphViz output only.

  XDot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This XDot was modified by Juha Jeronen, based on the original by José Fonseca.


Modifications:

- Focus animation now follows a nonlinear tanh spacing for a smoother-looking
  experience (slow-fast-slow).

- Uses system highlight color, queried from GTK.
  The actual node highlight color is mixed from the node's original color
  and alpha, and the system highlight with alpha=1.0.

- Keyboard shortcuts added for Zoom to fit (F) and Zoom to 100% (1).

- Keyboard shortcut added for Open (Ctrl+O).

- Tooltips added for the toolbar buttons, with the text showing also the keyboard shortcuts.

- The open dialog remembers the last used directory within the same session.

(Note that even current Linux distributions may ship a version which does not have the -n (no filter) option.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  analyze.sh
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The included analyze.sh is original. It is intended as a rudimentary wrapper for the pyan-fdp-xdot toolchain. The separate fdp step is useful, if one wants to quickly visualize the same data again (since xdot doesn't have to re-generate the layout).
