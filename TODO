xdot TODO:
  - clean corner cases
    - error when opening file: if no graph loaded yet, should display "[No graph loaded]"
  - when hovering over a node, highlight all linked nodes
    (better for exploring a large graph)
  - should have an icon in launcher under Unity shell
  - find by text in label (incremental search)
    - text field with the text "Search" in gray until clicked,
      then clear it and wait for user input.
    - buttons:
      - focus next (if multiple matches)
        - takes the "next" match (according to some ordering)
          and "clicks on that node".
        - if unique match, focus it
      - focus previous (if multiple matches)
        - same, with previous match.
    - make incremental an option? (may be slow)
  - bug: why doesn't the close button always show up when xdot is maximized
    under the Unity shell?
    (take partial screenshot with the windows key, then it bugs out)

xdot done:

  x- traverse by clicking: x(t) should follow tanh-like curve, not linear
  x- use the system highlight color
  x- keyboard shortcuts for 1:1 ("1") and fit to screen ("F")
  x- tooltips for toolbar buttons, including action name and shortcut
  x- the open dialog should remember the last used directory within the same session
  x- if input graph is empty, indicate somehow that a blank file was loaded
    x- create one node saying "[No input]" and render that?

xdot old todo:

  - highlight system:
    - make a small animation, so that the target flashes at first
      when highlighted
    - if the node has an alpha value, boost it but don't make it
      completely opaque.
    - color of the highlight:
      - keep original color but change lightness?
        (If dark, lighten; if light, darken)
      - mix in some blue tint?
      - change hue by 180 degrees?
