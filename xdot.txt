This XDot was modified by Juha Jeronen, based on the original by Jos√© Fonseca.


Modifications:

- Focus animation now follows a nonlinear tanh spacing for a smoother-looking
  experience (slow-fast-slow).

- Uses system highlight color, queried from GTK.
  The actual node highlight color is mixed from the node's original color
  and alpha, and the system highlight with alpha=1.0.

- Keyboard shortcuts added for Zoom to fit (F) and Zoom to 100% (1).

- Keyboard shortcut added for Open (Ctrl+O).

- Tooltips added for the toolbar buttons, with the text showing also the keyboard shortcuts.

- The open dialog remembers the last used directory within the same session.
