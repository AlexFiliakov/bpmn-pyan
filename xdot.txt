This XDot was modified by Juha Jeronen, based on the original by José Fonseca.


Modifications:

- The hover-over-node highlight system has been extended to make exploring large graphs easier. See below.

- Keyboard shortcuts added for Zoom to fit (F) and Zoom to 100% (1).

- Keyboard shortcut added for Open (Ctrl+O).

- Tooltips added for the toolbar buttons, with the text showing also the keyboard shortcuts.

- The open dialog remembers the last used directory within the same session.

- Focus animation now follows a nonlinear tanh spacing for a smoother-looking
  experience (slow-fast-slow).

- Uses system highlight color, queried from GTK.

  For nodes, the actual node highlight color is mixed from the node's original color
  and alpha, and the system highlight with alpha=1.0.

  For area zooming (shift+drag), the system highlight color is used with alpha=0.25.

- [No graph loaded] is shown when no graph is loaded (input error, no filename on command line, etc.).

- [Empty input] is shown when an empty graph is loaded (blank file, or valid graph but no nodes).

- Minor UI fixes (e.g. mouse cursor now changes to busy while loading).


In addition, the original contains some functionality that may be difficult to discover. Documenting these, from reading the source code:

- Shift-dragging allows to select a rectangular area to zoom to.

- Ctrl-dragging zooms smoothly.

- Hovering the mouse cursor over a node highlights it.

- Hovering over the end of a link (graph edge, "arrow") highlights the node at the other end of the link. (This is useful for exploring graphs.)

- Clicking a highlighted node centers it. Animated. The animation automatically zooms out and back in, if the view is highly zoomed and the destination node is near the edge of the view. If the destination is clearly visible, then the animation just pans the view.

- Clicking the end of a highlighted link (graph edge, "arrow") jumps to and centers the node at the other end of the link. (Animated.)

Mouse behaviour and keyboard shortcuts
--------------------------------------

Here is a complete list for both the original and modified versions of XDot. Unless otherwise specified, each item applies to both versions.

-----
Mouse
-----

Click the end of a link    = Center view to the node at the other end of the link
Click a node               = Center view to clicked node

Hover on the end of a link = Highlight link and the node at the other end
Hover on a node            = Highlight node                              [original version]
                             Highlight node and all its outgoing links   [modified version]
Alt+hover on a node        = Highlight node and all its incoming links   [modified version only]
Shift+hover on a node      = Highlight node, all its outgoing links
                             and the nodes connected by the links        [modified version only]
Ctrl+hover on a node       = Highlight node, all its incoming links
                             and the nodes connected by the links        [modified version only]

Mouse wheel up/down        = Zoom view in/out
Drag                       = Pan view
Shift+drag                 = Zoom to area (choose the area while dragging)
Ctrl+drag                  = Zoom smoothly

Dragging accepts both left and middle buttons.

--------
Keyboard
--------

Arrow keys                 = Pan view
+, =, Page up, keypad +    = Zoom in
-, Page down, keypad -     = Zoom out
F                          = Zoom to fit            [modified version only]
1, keypad 1                = Zoom to 100%           [modified version only]

Ctrl+O                     = Open file...           [modified version only]
R                          = Reload current file
Q                          = Quit XDot

Escape                     = Cancel current mouse drag action
